# Using Poseidon2 API

Sanity checks with standard sage output from attached sage script. The sage script originally from [Horizen labs code](https://github.com/HorizenLabs/poseidon2/blob/main/poseidon2_rust_params.sage) has been modified to print in standard format.

Note that the digest element of the Poseidon2 hash api is the output state of Poseidon2 at index 1.
