# Sumcheck benches

This example, instantiates a R1CS sumcheck instance with the parameters 
* `Sample size = 1<<22` field: BN254 scalar.
* Sumcheck IOP is part of a more general protocol, we use merlin to "simulate" a previous state of the transcript, and generate a seed randomness based on the previous state.
* The verifier also simulates the previous state of the transcript using Merlin to generate an identical seed randomness.
* In this example, we configured the Fiat Shamir protocol to run with the blake3 hash. Experiment with different hashes such as Keccak, blake2s , Poseidon etc. 
* Experiment with different sizes, fields, etc.
* The code runs in both CPU and GPU in a device agnostic manner. It assumes that the cuda backend is installed in the `icicle/backend/cuda/` folder, defaults to CPU in the absence of a device.
* Run the example with `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release cargo--package sumcheck --bin sumcheck`
