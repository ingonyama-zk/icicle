# ICICLE example: Polynomial API

## Key-Takeaway

`ICICLE` provides Rust bindings to Polynomial API [https://dev.ingonyama.com/icicle/rust-bindings/polynomials]

In this example we use the `BN254` and `babybear` fields to demonstrate how to compute on polynomials.

Running the example:
```sh
# for CPU
./run.sh -d CPU
# for CUDA
./run.sh -d CUDA -b /path/to/cuda/backend/install/dir
```
