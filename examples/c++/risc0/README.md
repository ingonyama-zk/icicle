# ICICLE example: RISC0's Fibonacci sequence proof using Polynomial API

## Why RISC0?

[RISC0 Protocol](https://www.risczero.com/) creates computational integrity proofs (a.k.a. Zero Knowledge Proofs) for programs executing on RISC-V architecture.
The proofs are created for sequences of values in RISC-V registers, called execution traces.
This approach is transparent to developers and enables the use of general purpose languages.

## Best-Practices

This example builds on [ICICLE Polynomial API](../polynomial-api/README.md) so we recommend to run it first.

## Key-Takeaway

RISC0 encodes execution traces into very large polynomials and commits them using Merkle trees.
FRI speeds-up validation of such commitments by recursively generating smaller polynomials (and trees) from larger ones.
The key enabler for *recursion* is the *redundancy* of polynomial commitments, hence the use of Reed-Solomon codes.

## Running the example

To run example, from project root directory:

```sh
# for CPU
./run.sh -d CPU
# for CUDA
./run.sh -d CUDA -b /path/to/cuda/backend/install/dir
# for METAL
./run.sh -d METAL -b /path/to/cuda/backend/install/dir
```
