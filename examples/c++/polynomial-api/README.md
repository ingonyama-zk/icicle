# ICICLE C++ examples of using Polynomial API 

```sh
cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DG2_DEFINED=ON -DCURVE=bn254 -S . -B build

1. Evalue polynomial at random point

2. Evaluate polynomial at roots of unity

This operation is a cornerstone in the efficient implementation of zero-knowledge proofs, particularly in the areas of proof construction, verification, and polynomial arithmetic. By leveraging the algebraic structure and computational properties of roots of unity, ZKP protocols can achieve the scalability, efficiency, and privacy necessary for practical applications in blockchain, secure computation, and beyond.
