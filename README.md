## Background

Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are considered one of the greatest achievements of modern cryptography. Accordingly, ZKPs are expected to disrupt a number of industries and will usher in an era of trustless and privacy preserving services and infrastructure.

If we want ZK hardware today we have FPGAs or GPUs which are relatively inexpensive. However, the biggest selling point of GPUs is the software; we talk in particular about CUDA, which makes it easy to write code running on Nvidia GPUs, taking advantage of their highly parallel architecture. Together with the widespread availability of these devices, if we can get GPUs to work on ZK workloads, then we have made a giant step towards accessible and efficient ZK provers.

## Zero Knowledge on GPU

ICICLE is a CUDA implementation of general functions widely used in ZKP. ICICLE currently provides support for MSM, NTT, and ECNTT, with plans to support Hash functions soon.

### Supported primitives

- Fields
    - Scalars
    - Points
        - Projective: {x, y, z}
        - Affine: {x, y}
- Curves
    - [BLS12-381]
    - [BLS12-377]
    - [BN254]

## Build and usage

> NOTE: [NVCC] is a prerequisite for building.

1. Define or select a curve for your application; we've provided a [template][CRV_TEMPLATE] for defining a curve
2. Include the curve in [`curve_config.cuh`][CRV_CONFIG]
3. Now you can build the ICICLE library using nvcc

```sh
mkdir -p build
nvcc -o build/<ENTER_DIR_NAME> ./icicle/appUtils/ntt/ntt.cu ./icicle/appUtils/msm/msm.cu ./icicle/appUtils/vector_manipulation/ve_mod_mult.cu ./icicle/primitives/projective.cu -lib -arch=native
```

### Testing the CUDA code

We are using [googletest] library for testing. To build and run [the test suite](./icicle/README.md) for finite field and elliptic curve arithmetic, run from the `icicle` folder:

```sh
mkdir -p build
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cd build && ctest
```

### Rust Bindings

For convenience, we also provide rust bindings to the ICICLE library for the following primitives:

- MSM
- NTT
    - Forward NTT
    - Inverse NTT
- ECNTT
    - Forward ECNTT
    - Inverse NTT
- Scalar Vector Multiplication
- Point Vector Multiplication

A custom [build script][B_SCRIPT] is used to compile and link the ICICLE library. The environement variable `ARCH_TYPE` is used to determine which GPU type the library should be compiled for and it defaults to `native` when it is not set allowing the compiler to detect the installed GPU type.

> NOTE: A GPU must be detectable and therefore installed if the `ARCH_TYPE` is not set.

Once you have your parameters set, run:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

You'll find a release ready library at `target/release/libicicle_utils.rlib`.

To benchmark and test the functionality available in RUST, run:

```
cargo bench
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

The flag `--test-threads=1` is needed because currently some tests might interfere with one another inside the GPU.

### Example Usage

An example of using the Rust bindings library can be found in our [fast-danksharding implementation][FDI]

### Supporting Additional Curves

Supporting additional curves can be done as follows:

Create a JSON file with the curve parameters. The curve is defined by the following parameters: 
- ``curve_name`` - e.g. ``bls12_381``.
- ``modolus_p`` - scalar field modolus (in decimal).
- ``bit_count_p`` - number of bits needed to represent `` modolus_p`` .
- ``limb_p`` - number of bytes needed to represent `` modolus_p``  (rounded).
- ``ntt_size`` - log of the maximal size subgroup of the scalar field.    
- ``modolus_q`` - base field modulus (in decimal).
- ``bit_count_q`` - number of bits needed to represent `` modolus_q`` .
- ``limb_q`` number of bytes needed to represent `` modolus_p``  (rounded).
- ``weierstrass_b`` - Weierstrauss constant of the curve. 
- ``gen_x`` - x-value of a generator element for the curve. 
- ``gen_y`` - y-value of a generator element for the curve.

Here's an example for BLS12-381.
```
{
    "curve_name" : "bls12_381", 
    "modolus_p" : 52435875175126190479447740508185965837690552500527637822603658699938581184513,
    "bit_count_p" : 255,
    "limb_p" :  8,
    "ntt_size" : 32,
    "modolus_q" : 4002409555221667393417789825735904156556882819939007885332058136124031650490837864442687629129015664037894272559787,
    "bit_count_q" : 381,
    "limb_q" : 12,
    "weierstrass_b" : 4,
    "gen_x" : 3685416753713387016781088315183077757961620795782546409894578378688607592378376318836054947676345821548104185464507,
    "gen_y" : 1339506544944476473020471379941921221584933875938349620426543736416511423956333506472724655353366534992391756441569
}
```

Save the parameters JSON file in ``curve_parameters``.

Then run the Python script ``new_curve_script.py `` from the main icicle folder:

```
python3 ./curve_parameters/new_curve_script_rust.py ./curve_parameters/bls12_381.json
```

The script does the following:
- Creates a folder in ``icicle/curves`` with the curve name, which contains all of the files needed for the supported operations in cuda.
- Adds the curve exported operations to ``icicle/curves/index.cu``. 
- Creates a file with the curve name in ``src/curves`` with the relevant objects for the curve. 
- Creates a test file with the curve name in ``src``. 

Testing the new curve could be done by running the tests in ``tests_curve_name`` (e.g. ``tests_bls12_381``).
