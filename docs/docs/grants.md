# Ingonyama Grants Program 2.0

Exactly one year ago, we launched our first-ever grants program, offering $100,000 to support research involving ICICLE. Today, we’re excited to announce our second grants program — another $100,000 dedicated to researchers. Details below!

### ICICLE ZK-GPU Ecosystem Grant

Ingonyama invites researchers and practitioners to collaborate in advancing ZK acceleration. We are allocating $100,000 for grants to support this initiative.

### Bounties & Grants
Eligibility for grants includes:

- **Students:** Utilize ICICLE in your research.
- **Performance Improvement:** Enhance the performance of accelerated primitives in ICICLE.
- **Protocol Porting:** Migrate existing ZK protocols to ICICLE.
- **New Primitives:** Contribute new primitives to ICICLE.
- **Benchmarking:** Compare ZK benchmarks against ICICLE.

Additionally, we’re encouraging researchers to reimplement algorithms from existing papers using ICICLE and aim to outperform their benchmarks. The larger the performance gain, the larger the grant reward.

### How to Apply

Applying is straightforward.

1. [**Fill out the form:**](https://forms.monday.com/forms/d0ed9699146d61e3b5a649b56ba2c663?r=use1) Start by telling us about your idea through the form, which will ask you to briefly describe your proposal, e.g., “I want to implement Whir in ICICLE” (note: this one’s already taken by Giacomo).
2. **Collaborate:** We’ll discuss and finalize the performance milestones together. Expect some back-and-forth to align on the project goals.
3. **Approval:** Once we’re aligned, we’ll greenlight the project.
4. **Get started:** Begin your work with our support and drive it toward success!
