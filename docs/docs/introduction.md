# Welcome to Ingonyama's Developer Documentation

Ingonyama is a next-generation semiconductor company building hardware accelerators for high-speed cryptography.
We design architectures that enable real-time performance for advanced cryptographic workloads. Our mission is to democratize access to compute-intensive cryptography—making it easy and accessible for developers to build the future of secure applications.

Our flagship product is **ICICLE**.

[ICICLE](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle) is a versatile cryptography library supporting multiple compute backends—including CUDA, CPU, Metal, and upcoming backends like WebGPU, Vulkan, and ZPU. Originally focused on GPU acceleration, ICICLE has evolved into a backend-agnostic framework for cryptographic acceleration. It enables you to build ZK provers and other cryptographic applications with ease, leveraging the best available hardware for your needs.

- **Multiple Backend Support:** Develop on CPU and deploy on various backends including CUDA, Metal, and others in the pipeline such as WebGPU, Vulkan, ZPU, or even remote machines.
- **Cross-Language Compatibility:** Use ICICLE across multiple programming languages such as C++, Rust, Go, and possibly Python.
- **Optimized for High-Speed Cryptography:** Accelerate cryptographic operations like elliptic curve operations, MSM, NTT, Poseidon hash, and more.

**Learn more about ICICLE and its multi-backend support [here][ICICLE-OVERVIEW].**

## Our Approach to Hardware Acceleration

We believe that GPUs are as critical for ZK as they are for AI.

- **Parallelism:** Around 97% of ZK protocol runtime is naturally parallel, perfect for GPU architectures.
- **Developer-Friendly:** GPUs offer simpler scaling and tooling compared to other hardware platforms.
- **Cost-Effective:** GPUs strike an ideal balance of performance and price—often 3× cheaper than FPGAs.
