# Supporting Additional Curves

:::note

Supporting additional curves is still a work in progress and is bound to change in the future. Currently, the process is very manual but plan to automate the majority of it in future releases.

:::

We understand the need for ZK developers to use different curves, some common some more exotic. For this reason we designed ICICLE to allow developers to add any curve they desire.

## ICICLE Core

ICICLE core is very generic by design so all algorithms and primitives are designed to work based of configuration files [selected during compile](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/blob/main/icicle/curves/curve_config.cuh) time. This is why we compile ICICLE Core per curve.

To add support a new curve you must create a new file under [`icicle/curves`](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/tree/main/icicle/curves). The file should be named `<curve_name>_params.cuh`.

We also require some changes to [`curve_config.cuh`](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/blob/main/icicle/curves/curve_config.cuh#L16-L29), we need to add a new curve id.

```
...

#define BN254     1
#define BLS12_381 2
#define BLS12_377 3
#define BW6_761   4
#define <curve_name> 5

...
```

Make sure to modify the [rest of the file](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/blob/4beda3a900eda961f39af3a496f8184c52bf3b41/icicle/curves/curve_config.cuh#L16-L29) accordingly.

Finally we must modify the [`make` file](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/blob/main/icicle/CMakeLists.txt#L64) to make sure we can compile our new curve.

```
set(SUPPORTED_CURVES bn254;bls12_381;bls12_377;bw6_761;<curve_name>)
```

## Bindings

In order to support a new curves in the binding libraries you first must support it in ICICLE core.

### Rust

Create a new folder named `icicle-<curve_name>` under the [rust wrappers folder](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/tree/main/wrappers/rust/icicle-curves). Your new directory should look like this.

```
└── rust
    ├── icicle-curves
        ├── icicle-<curve_name>
    │   │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   │   ├── build.rs
    │   │   └── src/
    │   │       ├── curve.rs
    │   │       ├── lib.rs
    │   │       ├── msm/
    │   │       │   └── mod.rs
    │   │       └── ntt/
    │   │           └── mod.rs
```

Lets look at [`ntt/mod.rs`](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/blob/main/wrappers/rust/icicle-curves/icicle-bn254/src/ntt/mod.rs) for example.

```
...

extern "C" {
    #[link_name = "bn254NTTCuda"]
    fn ntt_cuda<'a>(
        input: *const ScalarField,
        size: usize,
        is_inverse: bool,
        config: &NTTConfig<'a, ScalarField>,
        output: *mut ScalarField,
    ) -> CudaError;

    #[link_name = "bn254DefaultNTTConfig"]
    fn default_ntt_config() -> NTTConfig<'static, ScalarField>;

    #[link_name = "bn254InitializeDomain"]
    fn initialize_ntt_domain(primitive_root: ScalarField, ctx: &DeviceContext) -> CudaError;
}

...
```

Here you would need to replace `bn254NTTCuda` with `<curve_name>NTTCuda`. Most of these changes are pretty straight forward. One thing you should pay attention to is limb sizes as these change for different curves. For example `BN254` [has limb size of 8](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/blob/4beda3a900eda961f39af3a496f8184c52bf3b41/wrappers/rust/icicle-curves/icicle-bn254/src/curve.rs#L15) but for your curve this may be different.

### Golang

Golang is WIP in v1, coming soon. Please checkout a previous [release v0.1.0](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/releases/tag/v0.1.0) for golang bindings.
