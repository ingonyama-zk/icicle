### Opening a pull request

When opening a [pull request](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/pulls) please keep the following in mind.

- **Clear Purpose** - The pull request should solve a single issue and be clean of any unrelated changes.
- **Clear Description** - If the pull request is for a new feature, describe what you built, why you added it, and how it's best that we test it. For bug fixes, please describe the issue and the solution.
- **Consistent Style** - Rust and Golang code should be linted by the official linters (`gofmt` and `rustfmt`) and maintain proper style. For CUDA and C++ code, we use [`clang-format`](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/blob/main/.clang-format). See [here](https://github.com/ingonyama-zk/icicle/blob/605c25f9d22135c54ac49683b710fe2ce06e2300/.github/workflows/main-format.yml#L46) for how we run it.
- **Minimal Tests** - Please add tests that cover basic usage of your changes.
