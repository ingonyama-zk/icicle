# Ingonyama Grants Program 2.0

Exactly one year ago, we launched our first-ever grants program, offering \$100,000 to support research in high-speed cryptography using ICICLE. Today, we’re excited to announce our second grants program — another \$100,000 dedicated to researchers. Details below!

### ICICLE Ecosystem Grant

Ingonyama invites researchers and practitioners to collaborate in advancing high-speed cryptography acceleration. We are allocating \$100,000 for grants to support this initiative.

### Bounties & Grants
Eligibility for grants includes:

- **Students:** Utilize ICICLE in your research.
- **Performance Improvement:** Enhance the performance of accelerated primitives in ICICLE.
- **Protocol Porting:** Migrate existing cryptography protocols to ICICLE.
- **New Primitives:** Contribute new primitives to ICICLE.
- **Benchmarking:** Compare ZK and other cryptography benchmarks against ICICLE.

We’re also challenging researchers to reimplement algorithms from existing papers using ICICLE — and beat the original benchmarks. The bigger the performance gain, the bigger the grant.

### How to Apply

Applying is simple:

1. [**Fill out the form:**](https://forms.monday.com/forms/d0ed9699146d61e3b5a649b56ba2c663?r=use1) Start by sharing your idea, just a quick description, e.g., “I want to implement Whir in ICICLE” (note: this one’s already taken by Giacomo).
2. **Collaborate:** We’ll work with you to define clear performance milestones. Expect a bit of back-and-forth to align on goals.
3. **Approval:** Once we're aligned, we’ll greenlight the project.
4. **Get started:** Begin your work with our support and take it to the finish line!
