# ICICLE Compute APIs

This section of the documentation is dedicated to the main APIs provided by ICICLE. We will cover the usage and internal details of our core primitives, such as Multi-Scalar Multiplication (MSM), Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), and various hashing algorithms. Each primitive has its own dedicated page with examples and explanations for C++, Rust, and Go.

## Supported primitives

- [MSM](./msm.md)
- [NTT](./ntt.md)
- [Vector Operations](./vec_ops.md)
- [Polynomials](../polynomials/overview.md)
- _Hashing and commitment schemes coming soon_
