/**
 * @brief Performs the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) on the input data.
 *
 * This function executes the NTT or inverse NTT on the given input data, managing
 * tasks and reordering elements as needed. It handles coset multiplications, task
 * hierarchy, and memory management for efficient computation.
 *
 * The NTT problem is given at a specific size and is divided into subproblems to enable
 * parallel solving of independent tasks, ensuring that the number of problems solved
 * simultaneously does not exceed cache size. The original problem is divided into hierarchies
 * of subproblems. Beyond a certain size, the problem is divided into two layers of sub-NTTs in
 * hierarchy 1. Within hierarchy 1, the problem is further divided into 1-3 layers of sub-NTTs
 * belonging to hierarchy 0. The division into hierarchies and the sizes of the sub-NTTs are
 * determined by the original problem size.
 *
 * The sub-NTTs within hierarchy 0 are the units of work that are assigned to individual threads.
 * The overall computation is executed in a multi-threaded fashion, with the degree of parallelism
 * determined by the number of available hardware cores.
 *
 * @param device The device on which the NTT is being performed.
 * @param input Pointer to the input data.
 * @param size The size of the input data, must be a power of 2.
 * @param direction The direction of the NTT (forward or inverse).
 * @param config Configuration settings for the NTT operation.
 * @param output Pointer to the output data.
 *
 * @return eIcicleError Status of the operation, indicating success or failure.
