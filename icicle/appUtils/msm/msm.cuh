/**
 * @namespace msm
 * Multi-scalar-multiplication, or MSM, is the sum of products of the form:
 * \f[
 *  MSM(s_i, P_i) = \sum_{i=1}^N s_i \cdot P_i
 * \f]
 * where \f$ \{P_i\} \f$ are elements of a certain group, \f$ \{s_i\} \f$ are scalars and \f$ N \f$ is the number of
 * terms. In cryptographic applications, prime-order subgroups of elliptic curve groups are typically used, so we refer
 * to group elements \f$ \{P_i\} \f$ as "points".
 *
 * To solve an MSM problem, we use an algorithm called the "bucket method". For a theoretical background on this
 * algorithm, see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bl5mQA7UL2I) great talk by Gus Gutoski.
 *
 * This codebase is based on and evolved from Matter Labs'
 * [Zprize
 * submission](https://github.com/matter-labs/z-prize-msm-gpu/blob/main/bellman-cuda-rust/bellman-cuda-sys/native/msm.cu).
