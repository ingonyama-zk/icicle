 * Number Theoretic Transform, or NTT is a version of [fast Fourier
 * transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) where instead of real or complex numbers, inputs and
 * outputs belong to certain finite groups or fields. NTT computes the values of a polynomial \f$ p(x) = p_0 + p_1 \cdot
 * x + \dots + p_{n-1} \cdot x^{n-1} \f$ on special subfields called "roots of unity", or "twiddle factors" (optionally
 * shifted by an additional element called "coset generator"): \f[ NTT(p) = \{ p(\omega^0), p(\omega^1), \dots,
 * p(\omega^{n-1}) \} \f] Inverse NTT, or iNTT solves the inverse problem of computing coefficients of \f$ p(x) \f$
 * given evaluations \f$ \{ p(\omega^0), p(\omega^1), \dots, p(\omega^{n-1}) \} \f$. If not specified otherwise,
 * \f$ n \f$ is a power of 2.

  /**
   * @enum Ordering
   * How to order inputs and outputs of the NTT. If needed, use this field to specify decimation: decimation in time
   * (DIT) corresponds to `Ordering::kRN` while decimation in frequency (DIF) to `Ordering::kNR`. Also, to specify
   * butterfly to be used, select `Ordering::kRN` for Cooley-Tukey and `Ordering::kNR` for Gentleman-Sande. There's
   * no implication that a certain decimation or butterfly will actually be used under the hood, this is just for
   * compatibility with codebases that use "decimation" and "butterfly" to denote ordering of inputs and outputs.
   *
   * Ordering options are:
   * - kNN: inputs and outputs are natural-order (example of natural ordering: \f$ \{a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6,
   * a_7\} \f$).
   * - kNR: inputs are natural-order and outputs are bit-reversed-order (example of bit-reversed ordering: \f$ \{a_0,
   * a_4, a_2, a_6, a_1, a_5, a_3, a_7\} \f$).
   * - kRN: inputs are bit-reversed-order and outputs are natural-order.
   * - kRR: inputs and outputs are bit-reversed-order.
   *
   * Mixed-Radix NTT: digit-reversal is a generalization of bit-reversal where the latter is a special case with 1b
   * digits. Mixed-radix NTTs of different sizes would generate different reordering of inputs/outputs. Having said
   * that, for a given size N it is guaranteed that every two mixed-radix NTTs of size N would have the same
   * digit-reversal pattern. The following orderings kNM and kMN are conceptually like kNR and kRN but for
   * mixed-digit-reordering. Note that for the cases '(1) NTT, (2) elementwise ops and (3) INTT' kNM and kMN are most
   * efficient.
   * Note: kNR, kRN, kRR refer to the radix-2 NTT reversal pattern. Those cases are supported by mixed-radix NTT with
   * reduced efficiency compared to kNM and kMN.
   * - kNM: inputs are natural-order and outputs are digit-reversed-order (=mixed).
   * - kMN: inputs are digit-reversed-order (=mixed) and outputs are natural-order.
