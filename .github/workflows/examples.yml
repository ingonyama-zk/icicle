# This workflow is a demo of how to run all examples in the Icicle repository.
# For each language directory (c++, Rust, etc.) the workflow 
#   (1) loops over all examples (msm, ntt, etc.) and 
#   (2) runs ./compile.sh and ./run.sh in each directory.
# The script ./compile.sh should compile the example and ./run.sh should run it.
# Each script should return 0 for success and 1 otherwise.
